# Simplified Multitask4Veracity
This repository contains modified code for the paper "All-in-one: Multi-task Learning for Rumour Stance classification,Detection and Verification" by E. Kochkina, M. Liakata, A. Zubiaga 

See Kochkina's repository for more details, access via https://github.com/kochkinaelena/Multitask4Veracity  

This source code provides reproducebility to our data augmentation paper "Data Augmentation for Rumor Detection Using Context-Sensitive Neural Language Model With Large-Scale Credibility Corpus" by Sooji H., Gao, J., Ciravegna, F. (2019)

Augmented Raw data is based on [PHEME 6392078 dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/PHEME_dataset_for_Rumour_Detection_and_Veracity_Classification/6392078) and can be downloaded at
